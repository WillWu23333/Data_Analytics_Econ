    "### Topic:\n",
    "**\"How does a 10% surtax on Canadian canola oil impact CO2 emissions from agriculture due to substitution between canola and corn?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Canada’s heavy reliance on the Chinese market for canola exports, it is reasonable to anticipate the possibility of a surtax imposed on Canadian canola oil. And since corn and canola are both widely used in oil production, they are likely in a substitution relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact on CO2 emission will be discussed in the Counterfactual Analysis. A possible approach is to estimate CO2 emission with Carbon Footprints of planting these two crops.\n"

    "- **Key Shock**: The price change from, for exmple, a 10% surtax on Canadian canola oil can drive the substitution toward corn. This change in quantity can be captured by the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a **long-run model** , as it captures the elasticity of substitution between canola and corn, which reflects farmers’ decisions to shift land use or production in response to relative price changes.\n",

    "**Factors held constant** may include: total farmland, environmental factors (except temperature), and prices of other crops are assumed constant.\n",
